# IoT/WI - Finding Dory - Final Project [A.Y. 2021/2022]
This is the final project regarding the courses **Internet of Things** and **Wireless Internet**, A.Y. 2021/2022.
## ðŸ’¡ Introduction
The main purpose of the project is to find the coordinates $(X, Y)$ of the position of *Dory* by using a **fingerprint dataset** composed of Received Signal Strength Indicator (**RSSI**) values from six *sniffer-anchors* and the RSSIs emitted by Doryâ€™s smartphone in its corresponding coordinates.

The fingerprint dataset has been divided into small fragments of data hidden inside **MQTT publishes/subscriptions** and **CoAP request/response** packets and it was required to obtain all these fragments, clean them and remove the outliers.

After reconstructing the entire fingerprint dataset, it was necessary to find a model that was able to determine the position of the device with the most similar fingerprint, comparing the RSSI measurements from Doryâ€™s device with the databaseâ€™s entries.

This model, implemented within a **Python** script, exploits the **Euclidean Distance** to find the final coordinates $(X,Y)$ of Dory.
